Initially, we started off with logistic regression to establish a baseline for emotion detection, 
as it is simple and effective for classification tasks. However, the results were not as promising as we had hoped, 
prompting us to experiment further. We tried multiple methods, including SVM and Random Forest, each offering some improvements 
but falling short of our target accuracy. After extensive testing, we ended up moving forward with Naive Bayes, which consistently 
delivered the best results due to its strength in handling text data and probabilistic modeling.
